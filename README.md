2025年Global Game Jam作品
主题：Bubble
游戏名：Clicky Bubble
和主题的联系：提及Bubble，我第一反应就是小时候戳泡泡以及捏泡泡纸的快乐，于是便想把这种简单的快乐做进游戏中
玩法：
通过不同的方式戳破泡泡以得分，达到目标分数即可过关（泡泡和道具都可以被拖动）
由于时间和能力的原因，我没能把详尽的玩法介绍及各类泡泡和道具的效果放在游戏中展示，所以我便写在此处
游戏中有多种泡泡类型，我们需要通过不同的方式处理，泡泡中心显示血量，血量归零即被戳破

白色道具--炮台：每次点击会向四周发射子弹，每颗子弹造成一点伤害
黄色道具--双击：每次鼠标造成的泡泡的扣血会扣两次，且有三格能量，能量耗尽后道具失效，可通过点击恢复能量，每格能量使道具效果持续2秒
青色道具--拖动：有三格能量，点击可恢复能量，每格能量持续3秒，生效期间所有点击戳破的泡泡改为按住戳破

Global Game Jam entries for 2025
Theme: Bubble
Game Name: Clicky Bubble
Connection to the theme: When I think of Bubble, the first thing that comes to my mind is the joy of poking bubbles and squeezing bubble paper when I was a kid, so I want to put this simple joy into a game.
How to play:
Poke the bubbles in different ways to score points, reach the target score to pass the game (the bubbles and props can be dragged).
Due to time and ability, I was not able to put a detailed description of the gameplay and the effects of the various types of bubbles and props in the game to show, so I wrote it here
There are many types of bubbles in the game, we need to deal with them in different ways, the center of the bubble shows the amount of blood, and the bubble will be broken when the blood level reaches zero.
White bubbles - normal bubbles: you need to click on them with the left mouse button.
Green bubbles--right click bubbles: right mouse click is needed.
Blue bubbles--Roller bubbles: need mouse wheel to roll in any direction.
Cyan Bubbles - Drag Bubbles: Hold down and drag with mouse
Red bubbles--Aiming bubbles: need mouse to follow the bubbles for a certain period of time
Props: Props are white and solid color
White props - turret: each click will fire bullets in all directions, each bullet causes one point of damage
Yellow props - double click: each mouse caused by the bubble's deduction of blood will be deducted twice, and there are three cells of energy, energy depletion props disabled, can be restored by clicking on the energy, each cell of energy to make the props effect lasts for 2 seconds!
Cyan props - drag: there are three frames of energy, click to restore energy, each frame of energy lasts 3 seconds, during the effective period of all the click to burst the bubble to press and hold to burst
Purple item - Melancholy Mushroom: 3 cells of energy, click to restore energy, consume one cell of energy every time and deal AOE damage to enemies within the radius.
Gray prop - Magnet: three cells of energy, click to restore energy, each cell of energy lasts for 5 seconds, and continues to attract bubbles within the range while it is in effect.
Green props - Stinger: five cells of energy, click to restore energy, every time you touch a bubble, consume one point of energy to deal 2 damage to the bubble.
